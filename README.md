# Seng170Final
Advance Java final project, application to use at work to make a one stop shop for fellow employees to get commonly used script, part numbers, and error codes

***********One-Stop Shop program to be utilized by Amazon Robotics Advance Technicians*******************
User logins are held in a seperate txt doc that the program checks the user input to see if the user is valid to enter the program along with the *secret* password that only
advance technicians and engineers have to enter wifi node to access all robots and stations remotely within putty that is a linux based program.

Once logged in; 
----The top input box you can enter a drive units (amazon robot) output error code than recieve the description of what that error means.

----The left hand column are the main daily used putty scripts utilized to reboot drives and stations, update firmware, and troubleshoot. 
After clicking on a script you are wanting, it will output the script allowing the user to edit the drive unit number or station number before copying the script over to putty

----The right hand column are commonly used part names and if clicked on will output the part number that can be copied.

Still working on:
want to implement a document to hold all the part numbers and a button to add new parts to the system and scripts
